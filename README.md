### Hi there, I'm Matt 👋 An astrophysics PhD Student with a passion for robotics!

(He/Him)

Currently completing my PhD in astrophysics at the University of Melbourne 🌟 I'm also involved with the Melbourne Space Program. I mainly work on developing Python simulations to explore science cases for satellites in orbit 🛰️, but I'm looking to expand my skills in Machine Learning and data science 💻
